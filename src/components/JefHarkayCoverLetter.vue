			Hello there!
		</p>
		<p contenteditable="true">
			I’m Jef, and it’s nice to e-meet you!  I wanted to start by saying thank you very much for your time and consideration.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am a versatile developer that loves working with JavaScript/TypeScript.  My last 3 roles have been with Vue 3, which I thoroughly enjoy.  Above all, I love learning, so I am absolutely open to a React, Angular, Svelte, or other framework du jour roles.  I also enjoy full-stack work, as it allows me to see the entire pipeline from data to presentation, and it’s always nice to architect things.  Lastly, I am committed to quality, uniformity, best practices, and having lively conversations on pull requests.
		</p>
		<p>
			I’m looking for a team of talented developers where I can grow and collaborate in a lighthearted environment, with the opportunity to coach and mentor less experienced developers.  Additionally, I'm looking for a project(s) that has a large backlog of tasks that require an expert wrangler.  Bonus points if the application needs refactoring or rebuilding from the ground up.
		</p>

			In the past year that I have been unemployed, I have been keeping up-to-date with latest releases of NPM packages and learning new frameworks.  I recently decided to learn React and created an example e-commerce app.  I created the database structure, the back-end code, and the front-end code all from scratch.  I then deployed it to an AWS EC2 instance, and it’s stored on GitHub at <a

			>https://github.com/incutonez/ecommerce</a>.  Hopefully you can forgive the uncute UI, but the functionality speaks to my abilities to learn on the fly.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have worked on several other things too, like migrating my personal projects to Tailwind v4 and creating a scaffolding command that will create a workspace with a skeleton API, OpenAPI spec, and UI, either in React or Vue.  These commands add all my common configurations, like ESLint (and associated rules that I prefer), GitHub workflows, Tailwind theme, Husky, and semantic versioning.  Finally, I started working on a Phaser 3 tech demo of the original <a

			>Legend of Zelda</a>, but I have lost steam on that.
		</p>
		<p>
			If I've piqued your interest, I hope to hear from you soon!
