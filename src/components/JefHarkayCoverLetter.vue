			Hello there!
		</p>
		<p>
			I’m Jef, and it’s nice to e-meet you!  I am a versatile developer that loves working with JavaScript/TypeScript.  My last 3 roles have been with Vue 3, which I thoroughly enjoy.  However, I love learning, so I am absolutely open to a React, Angular, Svelte, or framework du jour role.  I also enjoy full-stack work, as it allows me to see the entire pipeline from data to presentation, and it’s nice to occasionally architect things my way.  Also, I can be a bit obsessive when it comes to quality, uniformity, and best practices, which is why my code review comments can be a little long.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a lot of experience with growing teams from scrappy to much more structured, and it can burn me out if I don’t get the proper support to do so.  This is why I have a longer list of previous employers.  I actually very much enjoy coming in with that energy and having others be as amped up as I am for the change, but if some devs are a bit stubborn and cause friction… well, you know, it’s not always fun.  It would also be nice to enter a team that is well-established and doesn’t require that amount of energy from me, so I can focus more on coding.
		</p>
		<p>
			What I’m looking for is a team of elite developers—or junior developers that would like some mentoring—that I can joke around with but also take the code very seriously and support one-another when the need arises.  Additionally, I'm looking for a project(s) that has a large backlog of tasks that require an expert wrangler.  Bonus points if the application needs refactoring or rebuilding from the ground up, as there's something cathartic and exciting about that process.
		</p>

			In the past year that I have been unemployed, I have been keeping up-to-date with latest releases of NPM packages and learning new frameworks.  I recently decided to learn React and created an example e-commerce app.  I created the DB structure, the back-end code, and the front-end code all from scratch.  I then deployed it to an AWS EC2 instance, and it’s stored on GitHub at <a

			>https://github.com/incutonez/ecommerce</a>.  It’s not the cutest UI, but I’m not a designer, so I hope you can forgive me!
		</p>
		<p>
			I have also worked on several other things, like migrating my personal projects to Tailwind v4 and creating a scaffolding command that will create a workspace with a skeleton API, OpenAPI spec, and UI, either in React or Vue.  These commands add all my common configurations, like ESLint (and associated rules that I prefer), GitHub workflows, Tailwind theme, Husky, and semantic versioning.  I also started working on a Phaser 3 tech demo of the original <a

			>Legend of Zelda</a>, but I have since lost steam on that because I need original assets to continue, so I don’t get sued by Nintendo.
		</p>
		<p>
			If I haven't scared you off, I hope to hear from you soon!
